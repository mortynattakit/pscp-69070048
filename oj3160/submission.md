# Problem Solving Submission

This file must be written by the student in their own words.

Use this template only for OJ problems that are marked as learning-log required.

Do not ask AI to write this file for you. AI may help check grammar, formatting, or clarity after you have written your own content.

If AI was used for this learning-log-required problem, also complete `ai_reflection.md`.

## 1. OJ Information

OJ problem number/title:

```text
OJ3160 - หาจำนวนเฉพาะ
```

OJ submission ID, if submitted:

```text
642250
```

OJ status:

```text
Pass
```

Independent time spent on this problem:

```text
1-3 hours
```

Choose one:

```text
0-15 minutes
15-30 minutes
30-60 minutes
1-3 hours
3-6 hours
6-24 hours
1-3 days
4-7 days
1-4 weeks
More than 4 weeks
```

How to count this time:

- Count only the time you actively worked on this problem independently.
- Start counting from when you first read the problem.
- Do not include breaks, meals, classes, sleep, time spent on other problems, or time when you were not working on this problem.
- If you used AI, count only the independent time before your first AI prompt.
- If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, count only the independent time before your first help request.
- If you used both AI and human help, count only the independent time before the first outside help of any kind.
- If you did not use AI or human help, count the time before writing this `submission.md`.
- An estimate is acceptable, but it must be honest.

## 2. My Understanding

Write the problem in your own words.

Also explain the input, output, and important constraints.

If you do not fully understand the problem yet, write what you currently understand. Your understanding may be incomplete or incorrect, but you must make a genuine attempt.

```text
The program must list all prime numbers that are between the start and the end of the input and print how many primes were found
Input:
Start and end value
Output:
If any primes were in between the start and end, print all the primes
print "Total primes: {numbers of prime between the given interval}"
```

---

## 3. My First Plan

Write your first plan before getting help from AI, a friend, a TA, an instructor, or before finalizing your code.

If you used AI, write the plan you had before your first AI prompt.

If you asked a friend, TA, or instructor for help, write the plan you had before asking for help.

If you did not use AI or human help, write the plan you had before or while you started coding.

This can be rough. It may be incomplete or different from your final solution.

You may write pseudocode, a flowchart idea, or step-by-step thinking.

```text
Step 1: Read the two integers from input
Step 2: Define a function that returns True if a number is prime using the 6k +/- 1 test
Step 3: Loop from start to end inclusive and call the prime function for each number
Step 4: Collect numbers that are prime into a list
Step 5: After the loop, print the list if it is not empty and then print the total count
```

## 4. My Final Approach

Briefly explain the final algorithm or method you actually used in your submitted code.

This section is different from Section 3:

- Section 3 is your first plan before AI, human help, or before the final code.
- Section 4 is the final method used in your actual solution.
- If your final approach is the same as your first plan, write that it is the same and briefly explain why.

Do not copy AI's explanation.

Do not copy another person's explanation.

```text
The solution defines a prime‑checking function that uses division up to the square root, skipping even numbers and multiples of three. It then reads the range, loops through it, stores primes in a list, and finally prints the list and the count using formatted output
```

---

## 5. My Tests

Write at least 3 test cases that you tried or designed by yourself.

Try to choose test cases that are different from each other.

For each test case, explain why you chose it.

If the input or output has many lines, write them inside the text blocks.

### Test Case 1

Why I chose this case:

```text
Tests with the interval where no numbers are prime and the start equals the end
```

Input:

```text
0 1
```

Expected output:

```text
Total primes: 0
```

Actual output:

```text
Total primes: 0
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 2

Why I chose this case:

```text
Checks a single number that is prime to see if the code can handle it or not
```

Input:

```text
29 29
```

Expected output:

```text
29
Total primes: 1
```

Actual output:

```text
29
Total primes: 1
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

### Test Case 3

Why I chose this case:

```text
Uses a range that includes both small and larger primes to verify correct detection across the interval
```

Input:

```text
2 20
```

Expected output:

```text
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
Total primes: 8
```

Actual output:

```text
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
Total primes: 8
```

Result:

```text
Pass
```

## 6. AI Use

Did you use AI for this problem?

```text
No
```

If yes, also complete:

```text
ai_reflection.md
```

If you only asked a friend, TA, or instructor and did not use AI, you do not need to complete `ai_reflection.md`.

---

## 7. Human Help / Collaboration

Did you ask a friend, TA, instructor, or another person for help on this problem?

```text
No
```

If yes, briefly explain what kind of help you received.

Allowed examples:

- explanation of the problem statement
- explanation of a programming concept
- hint about the approach
- debugging discussion
- test-case discussion
- help understanding an error message

Not allowed:

- copying another person's code
- submitting another person's solution
- asking another person to write the solution for you
- using another person's OJ submission
- asking another person to submit to the OJ for you

Who helped you?

```text
```

What did they help with?

```text
```

What did you still do by yourself?

```text
```

Did you copy any code from another person?

```text
No
```
